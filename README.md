# WINTER-PROJECT-ACTIVE-LEARNING
This project develops a deep learning model for image classification, focusing on accuracy, uncertainty, and robustness. A custom CNN was built using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. Uncertainty metrics (least confidence, entropy) and diversity metrics (cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence) were used to evaluate performance.
